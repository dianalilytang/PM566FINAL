# PM566FINAL

Title: PM 566 RSV Final

Description: This PM 566 Final Project was based on the "tripledemic" that took place in the 2022-2023 respiratory viral season. From 2022-2023 the pediatric population was hit with a surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) like never before. While previously believed to be a common virus among babies, this past winter RSV infected an increasingly large number of young children in the 0-4 age group. Children's hospitals were now overflowing with a particularly harsh respiratory season of RSV. COVID-19, Influenza, and Human Metapneumovirus were among the many respiratory illnesses that led to a lack of beds in children's hospitals. While children's hospitals went surprisingly empty during most of the pandemic from COVID-19, the winter of 2022-2023 escalated to a public health disaster with shortages of oxygen and beds for children while hospitals continued to fight the surges of COVID-19 in the adult population. This project aimed to look at shifts in the pattern and seasonality of RSV while also examining specific pediatric age groups with closer detail.
